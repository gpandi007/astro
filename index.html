            <h2>Krishnamurthy Paddhati (KP)</h2>
            <p>Krishnamurthy Paddhati (KP) is a system of astrology developed by Indian astrologer K.S. Krishnamurthy. It's known for its unique approach to horoscope analysis and prediction. In KP, the zodiac is divided into 249 sub-divisions called "subs," which are used to pinpoint the exact location of planets and their influences. KP also emphasizes the importance of the cusps (lines dividing the houses) and the role of the "significator" planet in determining the outcome of events. KP is considered a more precise and detailed system of astrology and is often used for answering specific questions and predicting future events.</p>
