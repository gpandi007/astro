# Basic HTML Website Replica (Partial)

This repository contains a basic, unstyled HTML replica of the Home, Services, and Contact Us pages from the website kpastrologer.com.

## Pages Created

*   `index.html` (Home page)
*   `services.html` (Services page)
*   `contact.html` (Contact Us page)

## How to View These Pages Locally

There are a couple of ways to view these HTML files on your local computer:

**Method 1: Download a ZIP File (Easiest)**

1.  **Download the Repository:**
    *   On the main page of this repository, look for a "Code" button (usually green).
    *   Click on it, and then click "Download ZIP".
2.  **Extract the ZIP File:**
    *   Once downloaded, find the ZIP file (e.g., `your-repo-name-main.zip`) in your Downloads folder.
    *   Extract its contents. You'll get a folder with the HTML files (`index.html`, `services.html`, `contact.html`) and this `README.md`.
3.  **Open HTML Files in Your Browser:**
    *   Navigate into the extracted folder.
    *   To view a page, right-click on the HTML file (e.g., `index.html`) and choose "Open with" then select your preferred web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
    *   Alternatively, you can open your web browser, and then drag and drop the HTML file directly into the browser window.

**Method 2: Clone the Repository (Requires Git)**

If you have Git installed on your computer, you can clone the repository:

1.  **Copy the Clone URL:**
    *   On the main page of this repository, click the "Code" button.
    *   Copy the HTTPS or SSH URL provided.
2.  **Open a Terminal or Command Prompt:**
    *   Open your terminal (Linux/macOS) or Command Prompt/Git Bash (Windows).
3.  **Clone the Repository:**
    *   Type `git clone <paste_the_URL_here>` and press Enter. For example:
        `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git`
    *   This will create a new folder with the repository's name in your current directory.
4.  **Navigate to the Folder:**
    *   Type `cd your-repo-name` to enter the cloned directory.
5.  **Open HTML Files in Your Browser:**
    *   As in Method 1, you can now right-click the HTML files in your file explorer and open them with a browser, or drag and drop them into an open browser window.

## Navigating Between Pages

Once you have `index.html` open in your browser, you can use the navigation links in the header (Home, Services, Contact Us) to switch between the created pages.

## Important Notes

*   **No Styling:** These are basic HTML files and do not include any CSS styling. They will appear as plain, unstyled web pages.
*   **No Backend Functionality:** Any forms (like the contact form) are visual representations only and will not submit data.
*   **No Images:** Image placeholders might be present in the code, but actual images from the original site are not included.
